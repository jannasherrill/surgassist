# Personal Notes
This project is so important to me and was mainly the driving point to make me want to start coding again. I'm incredibly passionate about this particular project as it is one of those issues I ran into in my last career that I knew there had to be a solution for. This is also a project that I will continue to work on as I grow more as a developer. As a travel surgical technologist, I started noticing a pattern from hospital to hospital. I encountered inconveniences like someone losing the preference card, a nurse walking away with the only physical copy of it, having to ask admin to print out a specific card because techs didn't have access to the EMR system, having to face angry doctors as you were handing them something that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt on their preference card‚Äù . It was also a constant battle of keeping the cards updated. As a tech and having worked in the operating room for so long, I knew there had to be an easier way. Everything else was easily at our fingertips, so why couldn‚Äôt the efficiency of an operating room be? Especially for hospitals that staffed travelers or agency workers like me, it needed to be easy to pick up a preference card and go on with the day. Far too often, I found myself not knowing what specifically needed to go on the mayo stand or not knowing what instrument or equipment the doctors were referring to because they had a special name for it. I had doctors asks for the ‚ÄúBadasses‚Äù referring to a certain type of scissors, or the ‚Äúfire stick‚Äù talking about the bovie cautery! I wanted to create a program that made it easy for any healthcare professional to be able to update, look at specific photos of instruments or supplies, view mayo stands for each specific doctor and create specific notes. A program that would also give doctors the ability to change whatever they wanted on their preference card at a click of a button.
